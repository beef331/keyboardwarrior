# Combat
Active ship can engage any ship or station to combat.
It is a turn based RPG.
Players can adjust their energy level based off their components to get more actions per turn.
For instance energy can be given to shields to reduce damage take, or weapon systems to allow loading or firing more.

There are 4 energy types Shields, Weapons, Engines, Logistics(hacking and the like).
Examples of weapons are as follows:
- Machine Gun - Does damage over turns for X turns
- Missile - Waits X turns before inflicting damage, can be intercepted
- Gauss Gun - Needs to be supplied energy over X turns then can fire instantly dealing damage

Shields take the amount of energy stored at end of turn and negate that damage each turn.



Ships can be hacked this gives you access to their shell which allows you to exit from combat, shoot other ships, or power down systems(this only effects next turn).
